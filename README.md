MVC Application for Comp 586
Assignment to create an MVC Application to support Services, Unit-Testing, Dependency Injection, and Object Relational Mapping - Not writing manual SQLs.
This MVC Application is connected to my SQL server using Entity Framework. It does support dependency injection, I just tested this myself by creating movie data and sending it to the local SQL DB.
